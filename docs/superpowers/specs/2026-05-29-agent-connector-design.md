# Weekly Eats Agent Connector — Design Spec

- **Date:** 2026-05-29
- **Branch:** `feat/mcp`
- **Status:** Approved design, pending implementation plans
- **Scope:** One spec, built in sequential implementation phases (see §11)

## 1. Summary

Build a way for AI agents (Claude) to interact with a user's Weekly Eats data. The
primary surface is a **remote MCP server** hosted inside the existing Next.js app —
i.e. a self-serve **Claude Connector** that any approved Weekly Eats user can add by
URL, authenticate with their own Google account, and use to read and write their
recipes, food items, meal plans, pantry, and shopping lists.

The motivating use case is a distributable, installable **`recipe-import` skill**:
give Claude a recipe URL or PDF, and it parses the recipe, maps ingredients to the
user's food-item catalog (creating new ones as needed), confirms everything in chat,
and saves a properly-structured recipe via the connector.

## 2. Goals

- A remote MCP server (Claude Connector) served from the deployed Next.js app on Vercel.
- Self-serve: any approved user connects with their own Google identity; data is
  scoped to that user exactly as the web app scopes it today.
- Read + write tools across recipes, food items, meal plans, pantry, shopping lists.
- A `recipe-import` skill that uses the tools with an in-chat human review step.
- No duplication of validation/ownership logic: MCP tools and HTTP API routes share
  one service layer.

## 3. Non-goals

- No second identity system. We reuse the existing Google/NextAuth login for the
  human-authentication step.
- No in-app "draft recipe" status or recipe-review UI. Recipe import review happens
  **in chat** (see §7), so the data model and app UI are unchanged for v1.
- No local CLI in this spec. The remote Connector is the surface. A developer CLI can
  be revisited later if a power-user/scripting need emerges.
- No changes to how the web app authenticates browser users.

## 4. Key decisions (with rationale)

| Decision        | Choice                                                                       | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Surface         | Remote MCP server = Claude Connector                                         | Self-serve "add by URL" can't be a local CLI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Hosting         | Route in the existing Next.js app on Vercel                                  | App already deploys to Vercel; shares auth + data layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Transport       | Streamable HTTP, **stateless**                                               | Current best practice; works with Fluid Compute; **no Redis** (Redis was only for legacy SSE / stateful sessions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Adapter         | `vercel/mcp-handler` over `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (≥ 1.26.0)             | Maintained Next.js adapter. Provides **only** the Resource-Server side: `withMcpAuth` (our `verifyToken` callback) + RFC 9728 metadata. Ships **no** Authorization Server — no DCR/PKCE/issuance/rotation; the SDK removed `ProxyOAuthServerProvider`. So the AS is hand-rolled by necessity (R5, §6.4). Pin a known-good version (see §10). |
| Data access     | **Shared service layer** (Approach A)                                        | One source of truth for validation/ownership; no drift between HTTP and MCP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Auth server     | **Hand-rolled OAuth 2.1 AS** on top of Google/NextAuth                       | Single identity, no new SaaS dependency. Weekly Eats becomes the Authorization Server; Google is the human-login step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Token model     | App mints its **own** MCP access/refresh tokens; Google tokens never exposed | "OAuth Proxy" pattern — control over token lifecycle, scope, revocation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Recipe review   | **In chat**, no draft state                                                  | Fastest, agent-native; avoids schema + review-UI work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Build structure | One spec, multiple implementation plans                                      | Pieces are tightly coupled (shared auth/service/tool conventions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## 5. Architecture overview

```
Claude (agent / recipe-import skill)
      │  MCP over Streamable HTTP (stateless)
      ▼
/api/mcp  ──withMcpAuth──►  verify MCP token → { userId, isApproved } in tool context
      │                              ▲
      │                              │ tokens minted by ↓
      │                     Weekly Eats OAuth AS (hand-rolled, §6.2)
      │                              │ login via Google/NextAuth, then
      │                              │ explicit user consent (CS1) before code issuance
      ▼
src/lib/services/*   ◄── same functions ──►  /api/* route handlers (thin wrappers)
      │
      ▼
MongoDB (user-scoped, unchanged collections + new mcp* collections)
```

The structural move: business logic migrates out of route handlers into
`src/lib/services/*`. Route handlers and MCP tools both become thin callers. One place
for validation, ownership, and user-scoping.

## 6. Components

### 6.1 MCP transport route — `src/app/api/mcp/route.ts`

- Built with `mcp-handler` wrapping `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
- Stateless Streamable HTTP. Exports `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, and `OPTIONS`
  (incomplete method export causes silent client failures).
- Registers tools with **zod** schemas (already a dependency).
- Wrapped in `withMcpAuth` (see §6.4); `required: true`.
- Runs on Vercel Fluid Compute; extend function timeout as needed.

### 6.2 OAuth Authorization Server (hand-rolled)

Weekly Eats acts as a spec-compliant OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server. New endpoints:

| Endpoint                                  | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`   | RFC 9728 Protected Resource Metadata; advertises the AS. Served by `protectedResourceHandler()`.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | AS metadata: issuer, authorize/token/register URLs, PKCE methods, supported scopes.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `/api/mcp/oauth/register`                 | Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591) — Claude auto-registers itself. Per-IP rate limited; see "AS hardening" below.                                                                                                                               |
| `/api/mcp/oauth/authorize`                | Authorization endpoint. Requires PKCE **and a server-verified `state`**. Bounces the user through existing Google/NextAuth login, then shows an **explicit consent screen** (CS1), and only on approval issues a short-lived, PKCE-bound auth code. |
| `/api/mcp/oauth/token`                    | Token endpoint. Exchanges auth code (or refresh token) for the app's own MCP access + refresh tokens, bound to `userId` and the resource indicator (RFC 8707). Re-checks approval on refresh; see "AS hardening".                                   |
| `/api/mcp/oauth/revoke`                   | Token revocation (sets `revokedAt`; see §9).                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

**Token flow:** Claude → `register` → `authorize` → (Google login via NextAuth) →
**consent screen → user approves** → auth code → `token` → MCP access + refresh token.
Google's tokens are never returned to Claude.

**Requirements enforced:** OAuth 2.1 + PKCE; Resource Indicators (RFC 8707) so tokens
are valid only for this MCP server; `401` responses carry `WWW-Authenticate` pointing
at the Protected Resource Metadata URL.

**AS hardening (required, from plan review):**

- **CSRF / `state` (I4):** `/authorize` generates a cryptographically random `state`,
  stores it server-side bound to the initiating request, carries it through the
  Google/NextAuth redirect, and verifies it on return **before** issuing the auth code.
  PKCE alone does not cover the authorization-request initiation leg.
- **Refresh & revocation (I5):** the token endpoint re-checks `isApproved`/`isAdmin`
  (and revocation status) from `users` on **every refresh exchange**, returning `401`
  and deleting the refresh token if the user is no longer approved. Refresh tokens use
  **rotation with reuse detection** (each refresh issues a new refresh token and
  invalidates the prior one; replay of a rotated token revokes the whole chain) and an
  **idle/sliding expiry** (TTL resets on use) rather than a hard absolute lifetime — so
  active users are never forced to periodically re-authenticate, while leaked or
  abandoned tokens still expire. **Rotation is atomic (S3):** perform it with a
  conditional `findOneAndUpdate` (filter: `hashedToken = H(R1)` **and** `replacedBy`
  unset **and** `revokedAt` null → set **only** `replacedBy = H(R2)`). `replacedBy` alone
  marks the token consumed (it can no longer match the filter), so `revokedAt` is
  reserved for "revoked for cause" (arch-002). If no document matched, the token was
  already rotated → revoke the whole chain (set `revokedAt` on every link). This mirrors the
  auth-code `findOneAndDelete` pattern (MA) and prevents a serverless race where two
  concurrent refreshes of the same token both succeed without tripping reuse detection.
- **DCR abuse (I6):** `/register` is per-IP rate limited; `mcpClients` documents carry
  a TTL/last-used cleanup policy (see §9). Registration is open per RFC 7591 but
  bounded by the rate limit; restricting to Claude's known client metadata is an option
  if abuse appears.
- **`redirect_uri` validation (S2):** `/register` rejects non-HTTPS `redirect_uris`
  (except `http://localhost`/`127.0.0.1` per RFC 8252). The AS stores them verbatim and
  matches **byte-for-byte** at `/authorize` — no prefix or wildcard matching. Without
  this, open registration lets an attacker register `redirect_uri=https://attacker.com`
  and exfiltrate a victim's auth code (RFC 7591 §5 open-redirector risk).
- **Auth-code single-use (MA):** `/token` consumes the auth code with an **atomic**
  `findOneAndDelete` (delete-on-exchange) so two concurrent exchanges of one code cannot
  both succeed on serverless. If an already-consumed code is presented again → `400`
  **and** revoke the access + refresh tokens issued from the first exchange (RFC 6749
  §4.1.2).
- **PKCE S256-only (sec-004):** the AS advertises and accepts **only**
  `code_challenge_method=S256`; `plain` or an absent method → `400`
  (`code_challenge_methods_supported = ["S256"]`). `plain` makes the challenge equal the
  verifier, which sits in the redirect URL — no real interception protection.
- **Auth-code client binding (sec-005):** `/token` verifies the request `client_id`
  equals the code's issuing `clientId` and the `redirect_uri` matches the authorization
  request's (both stored on `mcpAuthCodes`, §9) — OAuth 2.1 §4.1.3, so a different
  registered client cannot redeem another client's code.
- **Explicit user consent (CS1) — defense-in-depth, kept by choice:** after Google login
  and **before** issuing an auth code, `/authorize` renders a consent screen naming the
  requesting client and the access it will receive ("Allow _\<client_name\>_ to read and
  modify your Weekly Eats recipes, food items, meal plans, pantry, and shopping lists?")
  with Allow / Deny. A code is issued **only** on explicit Allow; Deny redirects back with
  `error=access_denied`. Consent is **not auto-skipped for an unrecognized client** just
  because a Google/NextAuth session exists. Recorded per `(userId, clientId)` (§9,
  `mcpConsents`); skipped only on an exact `(userId, clientId, scope)` match; a
  new/unrecognized `clientId` re-prompts. (v1 is single-scope, so exact-match suffices; a
  same-or-narrower **subset** check is a future multi-scope refinement — L5-arch-001.)
  One new piece of connector UI (a minimal,
  responsive server-rendered page); does not change how browser users authenticate.
  CSRF: the Allow submit carries the same server-verified `state` as the rest of the flow.

  **Accurate threat framing (corrected):** the MCP Security BCP's consent requirement is
  **conditional** — it targets proxies that authenticate to the _upstream_ IdP with a
  **static client ID shared across all users** _and_ rely on a replayable upstream consent
  cookie ("MCP proxy servers using static client IDs MUST obtain user consent for each
  dynamically registered client"). Whether we meet that precondition depends on how the
  NextAuth→Google leg is wired (resolve in Phase 2). Regardless, the **primary**
  authorization boundary here is the **`isApproved`/`isAdmin` allowlist** (M1) plus
  per-user data scoping: even if a victim were walked through the flow, no token is usable
  unless they are approved, and it is scoped to _their own_ data only — no cross-user
  access or privilege escalation. So CS1 is **not** the load-bearing control and should
  not be read as a Critical "silent-authorization" fix; it is BCP-recommended
  defense-in-depth and good consent UX, kept by explicit decision. (An earlier draft
  overstated this as a critical confused-deputy fix; corrected here.)

- **Issuer identification — `iss` (R1, RFC 9207):** every authorization response —
  **including error redirects** — carries an `iss` parameter equal to the AS's `issuer`
  in the metadata document. This is the recommended mix-up-attack countermeasure (RFC 9700) and matters because Claude talks to many connectors at once; the easy-to-miss
  part is emitting `iss` on the error path too.
- **PKCE-downgrade rejection (R2, RFC 9700 §2.1.1):** a distinct MUST beyond "require
  PKCE" — `/token` accepts a `code_verifier` **only if** a `code_challenge` was stored
  with that auth code, and rejects a code that had a challenge but arrives with no
  verifier. The `code_challenge` is persisted on `mcpAuthCodes` (§9) and the binding is
  an explicit, tested code path, not an implicit consequence of S256-only.
- **Token passthrough prohibition (R3, MCP Security BCP — normative MUST):** the MCP
  server **MUST NOT** accept any token not explicitly issued for itself (no accepting a
  raw Google access token as a bearer — enforced by the resource-indicator/audience
  check in §6.4), and **MUST NOT** pass a client-supplied token through to upstream APIs.
  This is a separate control from the consent screen (CS1): consent is UX, this is
  audience binding enforced inside token validation.
- **Discovery contract (R4, RFC 9728 + RFC 8414):** the Resource Server returns `401`
  with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer ..., resource_metadata="<PRM URL>"` (the exact RFC 9728
  §5.1 challenge form Claude parses), serves **path-aware** Protected Resource Metadata
  at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` ( + path segment), and the AS serves RFC
  8414 metadata at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`. PRM (`{ resource,
authorization_servers, scopes_supported }`) and AS metadata are **distinct documents** —
  a hand-rolled AS commonly serves only the latter; both are required.

**Approval gate at `/authorize` (L5-S1):** after the Google/NextAuth login callback,
`/authorize` checks `isApproved || isAdmin` from `users` **on every path before issuing an
auth code — including the consent-skip path** (the check gates _code issuance_, not merely
consent-screen rendering; L6). If false → redirect back with `error=access_denied` (no
consent screen, no code). This ordering matters because the prior-consent optimization
skips the consent screen entirely on a matching `mcpConsents` row, so a user who consented
while approved and was later un-approved must still be denied here. Without the gate, an
unapproved user completes the whole OAuth flow and receives tokens that are then rejected
on every `verifyToken` call — a confusing "connected but nothing works" state in Claude.
This is the authorize-time companion to the `verifyToken` (M1) and refresh (I5) approval
checks; §8a tests both the first-time and consent-skip (revocation-after-consent) paths.

**Approval re-check mechanism (M1):** `verifyToken` performs a **live `users` lookup on
every tool call** to read `isApproved`/`isAdmin` (not embedded in the token), so revoked
approval takes effect immediately. This is the intentional departure from the
JWT-cached web-app pattern in `src/lib/auth.ts`; the latency cost is one indexed lookup
per call and is accepted for a write-capable agent surface.

**Claude registration (resolved):** Claude uses **Dynamic Client Registration by
default** — it registers itself with our AS automatically — so `/api/mcp/oauth/register`
(RFC 7591) is a required Phase-2 deliverable, not optional. Manually-entered client
ID/secret (Claude's Advanced settings) is the fallback if DCR is ever unavailable. The
Protected Resource Metadata document must include `authorization_servers` and
`scopes_supported`; the AS metadata must advertise the authorize/token/register
endpoints and supported PKCE methods. Only residual: confirm exact field names against
the live Claude connector docs while implementing Phase 2.

**Reference implementations:** the closest real-world match is
**`bojanrajkovic/mcp-paprika`** (`src/auth/`) — a hand-rolled OAuth 2.1 AS for a Claude
connector that delegates identity to Google/OIDC and mints its own tokens, exactly our
OAuth-Proxy pattern, and is confirmed addable in Claude (incl. chat). It has direct
analogues to our collections (`client-registration`/`dcr-validator`, `auth-code-store`,
`token-store`, `auth-request-store`, `ttl-store`/`cleanup`, `allowlist`, `metadata`,
`oidc-client`/`presets`) and ships property-based tests for DCR/token logic — a strong
template. `DTeam-Top/mcp-oauth` is a secondary Next.js reference. Note the one structural
difference: `mcp-paprika` delegates login via a generic OIDC client; we instead reuse the
app's existing NextAuth+Google flow (our "no second identity system" decision) — confirm
the programmatic AS flow threads cleanly through NextAuth during Phase 2.

### 6.3 Service layer — `src/lib/services/*`

Pure, transport-agnostic functions, one module per domain
(`recipes.ts`, `food-items.ts`, `meal-plans.ts`, `pantry.ts`, `shopping-lists.ts`).

- Signature shape: `(userId: string, input: …) => Promise<Result>`.
- Encapsulate validation — **including `ObjectId.isValid(id)` for id parameters (ME)**,
  per the project convention — plus ownership checks, user-scoping, and Mongo access.
- Throw typed domain errors from **`src/lib/service-errors.ts`** (see §8a) — a new
  Phase 1 deliverable, since `src/lib/errors.ts` today exports only string constants,
  not throwable classes.
- Existing route handlers are refactored to call these (behavior-preserving).
- MCP tools call the identical functions.

### 6.4 MCP auth gate — `verifyToken` for `withMcpAuth`

The connector equivalent of `requireApprovedSession`:

- Extract the bearer token, hash it, look it up in `mcpTokens`; reject if missing,
  **not `tokenType: 'access'` (arch-001 — a refresh token must never be accepted as a
  bearer; RFC 6749 §1.5)**, expired, `revokedAt` set, or the resource indicator doesn't
  match (M3, §9).
- Resolve `userId`, then perform a **live `users` lookup** for `isApproved`/`isAdmin`
  (not embedded in the token — see M1 in §6.2) so revoked approval applies immediately.
- Enforce `isApproved || isAdmin` (matches `requireApprovedSession` semantics).
- On success return `AuthInfo` with `userId` (+ approval flags) in `extra`; tool
  handlers read `extra.authInfo`.
- On failure return `undefined` → `withMcpAuth` issues `401` with `WWW-Authenticate`
  (carrying the `resource_metadata` challenge, R4 in §6.2).

**`verifyToken` owns all the security logic (R5, build-vs-adopt reality):** research
confirmed that `mcp-handler`/`withMcpAuth` and the MCP SDK's bearer middleware do **only**
expiry + required-scope checks after our callback returns — they perform no signature
check, no introspection, no RFC 8707 audience compare, no revocation lookup, no
token-hash check, and no `tokenType` check. Therefore the hash lookup, `tokenType:
'access'` filter, `revokedAt` check, resource/audience match, and the live `users`
approval lookup all **must** live inside our `verifyToken` — they are not provided by the
adapter. (Neither `mcp-handler` nor `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` ships a reusable
Authorization Server; the SDK removed `ProxyOAuthServerProvider`/`mcpAuthRouter`. The AS
is hand-rolled by necessity, not just by preference — see §4.)

> **Phase-1 contrast — carryover, do not lose (2026-05-30).** The Phase-1 dev-token gate
> (`src/lib/mcp/verify-token.ts`, §11) intentionally **trusts `MCP_DEV_USER_ID` verbatim**
> and hardcodes `isApproved: true` — it does **no** `users` lookup and never confirms the id
> maps to a real, approved user. That is acceptable ONLY because the gate is dev-only and
> fully inert in production (`NODE_ENV !== 'production'` + both env vars required). When
> Phase 2 replaces `verify-token.ts`, the live `users` approval lookup above (M1) is the
> required replacement — the static-id trust **must not** carry over. Surfaced by the Phase-1
> `/review-code` pass; deferred to Phase 2 by explicit decision.

### 6.5 MCP tools

Thin wrappers over the service layer, grouped by domain. Each tool: zod input schema,
calls a service function with the authed `userId`, maps domain errors to MCP tool
errors. Initial (Phase set, §11):

- **Food items:** `food_items.search`, `food_items.get`, `food_items.create`.
- **Recipes:** `recipes.search`, `recipes.get`, `recipes.create`, `recipes.update`.
- **Later domains:** meal plans, pantry, shopping lists (read + write).

**Ownership-bearing fields (I3):** `food_items.create` via MCP **always forces
`isGlobal: false`** (personal items only). The existing HTTP route persists a
caller-supplied `isGlobal` with no admin gate (`food-items/route.ts:162`), so an agent
could otherwise publish globally-visible items into every user's catalog during import.
If admin-created globals are ever wanted, that path must re-check `isAdmin` from the MCP
auth context explicitly. Tool tests verify the forced `isGlobal: false` (see §8a).

**Override layer (A1):** to keep "routes and tools call identical service functions"
(§6.3) true, the `createFoodItem` **service** keeps accepting an `isGlobal` parameter
(preserving the HTTP route's current behavior). The **MCP tool wrapper** is what passes
`isGlobal: false` — the restriction lives in the tool, not the service. This avoids
silently changing the HTTP create path while still constraining the agent surface.

### 6.6 `recipe-import` skill

A distributable, installable Claude skill (`SKILL.md` + supporting files). It only
orchestrates MCP tools and the in-chat review — it never touches Mongo or the HTTP API
directly. Encapsulates the _judgment_ (parsing, fuzzy ingredient matching, unit
normalization, good confirmation questions); the connector enforces the _invariants_
(valid units, ownership, recipe structure). Installable and customizable in Claude.

**Source ingestion (resolved):** the skill relies on **Claude's native file/URL
reading** (Claude.ai, mobile, and Claude Code all ingest PDFs and fetch URLs) rather
than bundling its own fetcher/PDF parser. The skill operates on already-read content;
its job is extraction → tool orchestration. No parsing dependency to build or maintain.

## 7. Data flow — recipe import

```
User: "import this recipe: <url | pdf>"
  1. Skill fetches/reads the source; extracts { title, emoji?, ingredient lines, instructions }.
  2. For each ingredient line → food_items.search (fuzzy match against the user's catalog).
  3. Present in chat: matched food items + proposed NEW food items + parsed quantities/units.
  4. User confirms / corrects mappings.            ◄── human-in-the-loop, in chat
  5. food_items.create for each confirmed-new item.
  6. Assemble RecipeIngredientList[] with resolved foodItem ids + units.
  7. recipes.create → return a link to the recipe in the app.
```

Recipe structure is strict (per `src/types/recipe.ts`): each ingredient references a
real `foodItem` (with a unit) or another recipe by id — there is no free-text
ingredient. Steps 2–6 exist precisely to satisfy that invariant, and the connector
re-validates at `recipes.create`.

## 8. Error handling

- Service layer throws typed domain errors `ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`,
  `ForbiddenError` defined in **`src/lib/service-errors.ts`** (a new Phase 1
  deliverable — `@/lib/errors` provides only the message-string constants, which each
  error class carries). Route handlers and tools `instanceof`-check these.
- HTTP route handlers map these to existing status codes (400/403/404/500) — external
  API behavior is unchanged.
- MCP tools map these to MCP tool errors (`isError: true` + an actionable message
  Claude can respond to, e.g. "no matching food item; create one or pick another").
- Auth: missing/invalid token → `401` + `WWW-Authenticate` (triggers OAuth);
  authenticated-but-unapproved → a clear "not approved" tool error.
- Continue using `logError('ContextName', error)` server-side.

## 8a. Testing strategy

Every phase ships with tests, following the existing `__tests__/` + `vi.mock('@/lib/mongodb')`
pattern (see `docs/testing.md`). No phase is "done" on "tests stay green" alone.

- **Service layer (Phase 1)** — unit tests per function: happy path; `userId` scoping
  (never returns/ mutates another user's docs); ownership rejection → `ForbiddenError`;
  validation rejection → `ValidationError` with the right `@/lib/errors` constant;
  **malformed (non-ObjectId) id → `ValidationError` (ME)**; unknown id → `NotFoundError`.
  Plus: existing route-handler tests still pass after the refactor (behavior-preserving).
- **MCP tools (Phase 1)** — mock `@/lib/services/*` (not Mongo): correct service called
  with the authed `userId` from `extra.authInfo`; domain errors mapped to `isError`
  responses; zod input rejection produces a readable MCP error; `food_items.create`
  forces `isGlobal: false`.
- **`verifyToken` (Phase 2)** — valid token resolves to `{ userId, isApproved, isAdmin }`;
  expired token → `undefined`; revoked token (`revokedAt` set) → `undefined`;
  unapproved + non-admin → `undefined`; admin bypasses approval; malformed/forged
  bearer → `undefined`; resource-indicator mismatch → `undefined`.
  **Hashed-bearer lookup (T1):** a record keyed on `SHA-256(T)` matches raw bearer `T`,
  and submitting `SHA-256(T)` as the bearer does **not** match — proves the hash step is
  live, not just documented. **Post-issuance revocation (T3):** with the `mcpTokens`
  record still valid (non-expired, non-revoked) but the **live `users` lookup** returning
  `isApproved: false`, `verifyToken` → `undefined` — proves the live lookup governs, not
  a value cached in the token (the M1 guarantee). **Refresh-as-bearer (arch-001):** a
  valid, non-expired refresh token presented as the bearer → `undefined` (only
  `tokenType: 'access'` is accepted).
- **OAuth AS endpoints (Phase 2)** — `/token`: successful PKCE code exchange;
  `code_verifier` mismatch → 400; missing verifier → 400; expired auth code → 400;
  **unknown/unregistered `client_id` → 400/401 (T4)** (client auth per OAuth 2.1; mock
  `mcpClients.findOne` → null); **valid-but-wrong `client_id` or `redirect_uri` — code
  issued to client A, exchanged by client B → 400 (sec-005)**; replayed (single-use)
  code → 400 **and tokens from the first exchange are revoked (MA)**; **concurrent refresh of one token — exactly one
  succeeds, the loser triggers chain revocation (S3 atomicity)**; successful refresh
  **with** approval re-check; refresh by a now-unapproved user
  → 401 + token deleted; rotated-token replay revokes the chain. **Idle/sliding TTL
  (T2):** a successful refresh sets the replacement token's expiry relative to the
  exchange time; a token left unused past its idle window is rejected even if the
  absolute time since first issuance is short. `/authorize`: missing `code_challenge` →
  400; **`code_challenge_method=plain` or absent → 400 (sec-004)**; missing/!verified
  `state` → 400; **`state` cross-session isolation (MC)** — a valid `state` value
  generated in session A is rejected when replayed in session B; **expired
  `mcpAuthStates` doc rejected by application code (past `expiresAt`, mock lookup to
  bypass the TTL reaper) → 400 (test-001)**;
  `redirect_uri` mismatch → 400; unapproved user cannot obtain a code; **consent
  required (CS1)** — authenticated user, no prior `mcpConsents` row for this `(userId,
clientId)` → consent screen shown, **no code issued until Allow**; **Deny → redirect
  with `error=access_denied`, no code**; **prior-consent skip** — an exact `(userId,
clientId, scope)` match in `mcpConsents` issues a code without re-prompting, but a new
  `clientId` re-prompts even with a live Google session (silent-authorization guard);
  **approval gate on the skip path (L6)** — a user with a matching `mcpConsents` row but
  `isApproved: false` (consented while approved, later un-approved) is still denied at
  `/authorize` with `error=access_denied` and **no code**, proving the gate runs on the
  consent-skip path, not only at consent-screen rendering;
  **happy path (MD)** — valid `code_challenge` + matching `state` + approved user +
  consent → code issued, `state` single-use. `/register`: rate-limit enforced;
  **non-HTTPS `redirect_uri` (non-localhost) → 400 (S2)**. `/revoke`: valid revocation succeeds; unknown token succeeds silently
  (RFC 7009 §2.2); unauthenticated → 401.
- **OAuth-AS research cases (Phase 2)** — `iss` present on `/authorize` **success and
  error** responses, equal to AS issuer (R1); PKCE downgrade — stored `code_challenge`
  but token request omits `code_verifier` → 400, and a `code_verifier` with no stored
  challenge → 400 (R2); token-passthrough/audience — a token whose bound `resource` is
  not this server (incl. a raw upstream/Google token) → `verifyToken` `undefined` (R3);
  at-use expiry — a code/token/state with past `expiresAt` but still-present document
  (mock store to simulate ≤60s TTL-reaper lag) → rejected by the app-code expiry check
  (R6); discovery — unauthenticated MCP request → `401` with `WWW-Authenticate` carrying
  `resource_metadata="<PRM URL>"`, and the RFC 9728 PRM + RFC 8414 AS-metadata documents
  are served and well-formed (R4).
- **Phase 1 dev-token gate (Phase 2)** — integration test asserting the production
  configuration rejects the static dev token (see §11, C1).
- **Skill (Phase 3)** — validated manually.

## 9. Data model changes

No changes to existing collections. New collections for the AS:

- `mcpClients` — registered OAuth clients (from DCR). Carries a `lastUsedAt`/TTL
  cleanup policy so abandoned registrations are reaped (I6).
- `mcpAuthCodes` — short-lived PKCE-bound authorization codes. Each stores the issuing
  **`clientId`, `redirectUri`, PKCE `code_challenge`, and the bound `resource`** (RFC
  8707); `/token` verifies the request's `client_id` and `redirect_uri` match these at
  exchange (sec-005, OAuth 2.1 §4.1.3 — prevents cross-client code injection), accepts a
  `code_verifier` only if a `code_challenge` was stored (R2 PKCE-downgrade rejection),
  and carries the `resource` through to the minted token's audience. **Single-use enforced via an atomic
  `findOneAndDelete` on exchange (MA)** — not a read-then-delete — so concurrent
  serverless exchanges of one code cannot both succeed.
- `mcpTokens` — access + refresh tokens bound to `userId`, each with a
  **`tokenType: 'access' | 'refresh'`** discriminator (arch-001; `verifyToken` accepts
  only `'access'`), expiry, and a `revokedAt` field. Refresh tokens use rotation (a
  `replacedBy`/chain reference) for reuse detection and an idle/sliding TTL; rotation is
  performed with an **atomic conditional `findOneAndUpdate`** (S3, §6.2).
- `mcpAuthStates` (A2) — one document per in-flight `/authorize` request, holding the
  `state` nonce (or its hash), `clientId`, `redirectUri`, and a short TTL (~10 min).
  Single-use: deleted on the callback after verification. This is where the I4 `state`
  lives (the stateless runtime can't hold it in memory, and the auth code doesn't exist
  yet at redirect time). A signed, short-lived server-side cookie is an acceptable
  alternative; the collection is the default.
- `mcpConsents` (CS1) — one document per `(userId, clientId)` recording that the user
  granted this client access, with `scope` and `grantedAt`. `/authorize` skips the
  consent screen only on an exact `(userId, clientId, scope)` match (single-scope in v1; a
  same-or-narrower subset check is a future multi-scope refinement, L5-arch-001); a new
  `clientId`, or a different scope, re-prompts. Revoked when the user revokes the client
  (a future "connected apps" management surface can delete these rows).

**Storage format (M2 + S1):** access tokens, **refresh tokens**, and auth codes are all
persisted as **SHA-256 hashes**, never plaintext — the raw secret is returned to the
client once at issuance and never stored. The token endpoint hashes an incoming refresh
token before lookup and stores its rotated replacement as a hash. A database read
therefore cannot impersonate a user or mint new tokens (refresh tokens are the
long-lived secret, so hashing them is as important as hashing access tokens).
**Generation (S4):** raw tokens, auth codes, and `state` nonces are generated from a
CSPRNG (`crypto.randomBytes(32)`, ≥256 bits) — hashing at rest does not compensate for a
weak source, so the entropy must come from generation.

**Revocation (M3):** `/revoke` (and refresh-rotation/approval-loss) sets `revokedAt`
rather than deleting the document, so `verifyToken` and the token endpoint **must check
`revokedAt`** on every use. TTL indexes are keyed on the **expiry** field (not
`revokedAt`), so MongoDB's eventual TTL deletion never races ahead of an explicit
revocation check.

**TTL is cleanup, not security (R6, Vercel/Mongo):** MongoDB's TTL reaper runs only
~every 60s (longer under load), so an expired auth code/token/state remains _queryable_
for ≥60s past its `expiresAt`. Every consumer (`/token`, `/authorize` callback,
`verifyToken`) **must compare `expiresAt` against the current time at use** and reject if
past — never treat "document still present" as "still valid". For auth codes (lifetimes
in seconds) this at-use check is the actual single-use/expiry guarantee; the TTL index
only reclaims space. (Pair with the atomic `findOneAndDelete`/`findOneAndUpdate` already
specified.)

Indexes added to `src/lib/database-indexes.ts` (TTL on `mcpAuthCodes`/`mcpTokens`/
`mcpAuthStates` expiry; `mcpClients` cleanup; lookup indexes on the hashed-token
fields). **Also add the five `mcp*` collections (`mcpClients`, `mcpAuthCodes`,
`mcpTokens`, `mcpAuthStates`, `mcpConsents`) to the hardcoded list in `dropAllIndexes()`
(`database-indexes.ts:155`) (MB)**, or dev/test resets leave stale `mcp*` indexes behind.

## 10. Security considerations

- **User-scoping is non-negotiable:** every service function filters by the authed
  `userId`; no tool accepts a caller-supplied user id. `food_items.create` forces
  `isGlobal: false` (I3, §6.5).
- **Approval gating** enforced at **three** points: `/authorize` before code issuance
  (L5-S1), every refresh exchange (I5), and live on every tool call (M1) — never only at
  token issuance. See §6.2.
- **Token isolation:** Google tokens never leave the server; only app-minted MCP
  tokens reach Claude, stored hashed at rest (M2, §9). Tokens are resource-scoped
  (RFC 8707).
- **PKCE + `state` required** on the authorization code flow (I4, §6.2); DCR endpoint
  is rate limited (I6, §6.2).
- **Explicit consent (CS1) — defense-in-depth:** `/authorize` requires user approval
  before issuing a code and doesn't auto-skip for an unrecognized client. This is the
  BCP-recommended (conditionally-required) consent control, **not** the primary boundary
  — the `isApproved` allowlist + per-user scoping is what actually prevents cross-user
  access (see corrected framing in §6.2).
- **Token passthrough is prohibited (R3):** only tokens this server minted (correct
  `resource`/audience) are accepted; client-supplied tokens are never forwarded upstream.
  Audience binding is enforced in `verifyToken`, independent of consent (§6.2, §6.4).
- **Expiry is checked at use, not via TTL (R6):** the Mongo TTL reaper lags ≥60s, so
  every code/token/state use re-checks `expiresAt`; TTL is only space reclamation (§9).
- **Issuer + PKCE-downgrade (R1/R2):** `iss` on all authorization responses (mix-up
  defense); a `code_verifier` is honored only against a stored `code_challenge` (§6.2).
- **Pinned dependencies:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` ≥ 1.26.0 (prior versions have
  advisories). Per the `mcp-handler` README, **Redis is optional and only needed for
  the legacy SSE transport** — stateless Streamable HTTP needs none. The earlier
  no-Redis infinite-loop issue (vercel/vercel#13321) is closed; use a current
  `mcp-handler` release.
- **Least privilege:** v1 uses a single scope granting the user access to their own
  data; finer scopes can come later.

## 11. Implementation phases

One spec, built and reviewed as separate plans (run `writing-plans` per phase):

**Phase 1 — Service layer + recipes/food-items tools (behind a dev token).**
Add `src/lib/service-errors.ts` (typed throwable errors, §8); extract
`services/recipes.ts` and `services/food-items.ts`; refactor the existing routes to call
them (existing tests stay green) and add the service + tool tests in §8a. Stand up
`/api/mcp` (stateless Streamable HTTP) with the recipes + food-items tools.
**Dev-token gate (C1):** the temporary static bearer token is enabled **only** when
`MCP_DEV_TOKEN` is set **and** `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` — it is never wired into any
deployed environment. _Deliverable: tools callable from a local MCP client._

**Phase 2 — OAuth Authorization Server + approval-gated verification + deploy.**
Implement the AS endpoints (§6.2) including `state`/CSRF, the **consent screen (CS1)**,
refresh re-approval + rotation, DCR rate limiting, and hashed token storage; implement
`verifyToken` (§6.4); create the `mcp*` collections + indexes (§9, incl. `mcpConsents`);
add the §8a auth tests. The consent screen is a minimal server-rendered, responsive
(phone-width) page — the only new connector UI. **Exit checklist:** the
Phase 1 dev-token code path is removed or provably inert in production, verified by the
§8a integration test, before deploy. Replace the dev token with real OAuth.
_Deliverable: a self-serve connector an approved user can add in Claude and use for
recipes + food items._

**Phase 3 — `recipe-import` skill.**
Build and package the skill (§6.6) on top of Phase 1–2 tools. _Deliverable: the
motivating use case, installable in Claude._

**Phase 4 — Remaining domains.**
Extract services + register tools for meal plans, pantry, and shopping lists, repeating
the established pattern. _Deliverable: full read/write tool surface._

## 12. Open questions / risks

Resolved during design (see §6.2, §6.6, §10): Claude DCR is a confirmed Phase-2
requirement; the stateless/Redis concern is cleared (Redis is SSE-only); PDF/URL
ingestion uses Claude's native file reading.

Resolved during plan review (see `2026-05-29-agent-connector-design-review.md`): the
OAuth AS now specifies `state`/CSRF (I4), refresh re-approval + rotation + idle expiry
(I5), DCR rate limiting + `mcpClients` TTL (I6), hashed token storage (M2),
`revokedAt`-based revocation (M3), and live approval re-check (M1); the spec adds a
Testing strategy (§8a, I1), a `service-errors.ts` deliverable (I2), the
`food_items.create` `isGlobal: false` rule (I3), and the Phase 1 dev-token gate (C1).

Resolved during plan review loop 2 (see the same review file): refresh tokens are now
hashed too (S1); `/register` validates `redirect_uri` (HTTPS + byte-match, S2); the
`isGlobal: false` override is pinned to the tool layer (A1); auth codes are single-use
via atomic `findOneAndDelete` + revoke-on-replay (MA); `dropAllIndexes()` must include
the `mcp*` collections (MB); §6.3 calls out `ObjectId.isValid` (ME); and §8a gains test
cases for hashed-bearer lookup (T1), idle TTL (T2), post-issuance live revocation (T3),
`state` cross-session isolation (MC), the `/authorize` happy path (MD), and malformed
ids (ME).

Resolved during plan review loop 3 (see the same review file): refresh-token rotation is
**atomic** via conditional `findOneAndUpdate` (S3); a new `mcpAuthStates` collection
holds the I4 `state` nonce (A2); tokens/codes/state are generated from a CSPRNG (S4);
and §8a adds `/token` unknown-`client_id` and concurrent-rotation cases (T4 + S3).

Resolved during plan review loop 4 (deep security pass): `mcpTokens` gains a `tokenType`
discriminator and `verifyToken` accepts only access tokens (arch-001); `mcpAuthCodes`
stores and `/token` verifies `clientId`/`redirectUri` (sec-005); PKCE is S256-only,
`plain` rejected (sec-004); the S3 rotation update payload is clarified (arch-002); and
§8a adds refresh-as-bearer, cross-client-code, `plain`-rejection, and expired-`state`
cases.

Added after loop 4 (user decision): an **explicit user-consent screen (CS1)** on
`/authorize` before code issuance, never auto-skipped for an unrecognized client on an
existing Google session — closing the confused-deputy / silent-authorization vector that
open DCR enables. New `mcpConsents` collection (§9); §8a gains consent-required, Deny,
and prior-consent-skip cases (§6.2, §8a, §10). This was raised, then set aside as
out-of-scope, during loop 4; the user elected to include it.

Resolved during dedicated OAuth-AS research (25 primary-source claims, all confirmed —
see References): the **hand-roll decision is validated** — neither `mcp-handler` nor the
MCP SDK ships a reusable Authorization Server (the SDK removed `ProxyOAuthServerProvider`),
so the AS is hand-rolled by necessity; an independent working Claude connector
(`mcp-paprika`) uses the same OAuth-Proxy pattern. Added GAPs the prior checklist didn't
name: RFC 9207 `iss` on all authorization responses incl. errors (R1); explicit
PKCE-downgrade rejection (R2); the token-passthrough prohibition as a distinct
audience-binding control (R3); the full RFC 9728 + RFC 8414 discovery contract incl. the
`resource_metadata` `401` challenge (R4); the explicit statement that `verifyToken` owns
all security logic since the adapter only checks expiry+scope (R5); and the
TTL-is-cleanup-not-security at-use expiry rule (R6).

Remaining:

- **Exact Claude DCR/metadata field names:** confirm against the live Claude connector
  docs while implementing Phase 2 (low risk — shape is known, only field-name details
  remain).
- **Newer MCP auth revision:** a `2025-11-25` MCP authorization revision exists; the
  research confirmed it does not contradict the `2025-06-18` requirements used here, but
  re-check it against the newest revision before implementing Phase 2.
- **NextAuth/Auth.js threading (gated by #142):** confirm the programmatic AS
  authorize→login→callback flow threads cleanly through the app's Google login (vs.
  `mcp-paprika`'s direct OIDC-client approach) during Phase 2. **Issue #142 migrates
  `next-auth` v4 → Auth.js v5 (`auth()` + redirect proxy, so Google login works on Vercel
  preview deploys) and is folded into this effort as Phase 1.5 — it gates Phase 2.** Build
  the AS login leg against the **v5** surface, not v4, to avoid redoing auth-critical code.
  Also evaluate whether the connector's Google-callback leg should ride on v5's redirect
  proxy (reusing its origin allowlisting) rather than reinventing it. (#142 sequences around
  the in-flight dependency upgrades it references.)
- **Vercel specifics (deferred to Phase 2):** clock-skew tolerance for second-scale code
  expiry across regions; signing/hashing-pepper secret management (env var vs KMS).
- **Service extraction surface:** keep each phase's refactor scoped to the routes that
  phase exposes; avoid a big-bang refactor of all routes at once. (Process guideline,
  not an unknown.)
