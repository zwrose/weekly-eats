# Food Item Input Migration Progress

## Phase 1: Test Current Behavior ✅ IN PROGRESS

### Completed
- [x] Created test structure for core hooks (use-food-item-selector, use-food-item-creator, use-quantity-input)
- [x] Created behavior test for IngredientInput component
- [x] Documented expected behaviors in test files

### In Progress
- [ ] Complete behavior tests for all current implementations
- [ ] Write integration tests for shopping lists
- [ ] Write integration tests for pantry
- [ ] Verify all test coverage requirements are met

### Next Steps
1. Complete remaining behavior tests
2. Move to Phase 2: Extract core hooks
3. Make tests pass by implementing hooks

## Test Files Created

### Hook Tests (Placeholders - will be implemented in Phase 2)
- `src/lib/hooks/__tests__/use-food-item-selector.test.ts`
- `src/lib/hooks/__tests__/use-food-item-creator.test.ts`
- `src/lib/hooks/__tests__/use-quantity-input.test.ts`

### Component Behavior Tests
- `src/components/food-item-inputs/__tests__/IngredientInput.behavior.test.tsx`

## Notes

- Tests are currently placeholders documenting expected behavior
- Will be implemented in Phase 2 when hooks are created
- Behavior tests capture current working implementations to ensure consistency
