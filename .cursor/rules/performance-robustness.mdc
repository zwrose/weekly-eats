Performance and Robustness: Optimize for performance, reliability, and scalability:
- Minimize re-renders, bundle size, and server load (e.g., React.memo, ISR).
- Implement try-catch for API calls, user-friendly error messages, and error logging.
- Address edge cases (e.g., empty states, network failures).
- Measure performance with Lighthouse or @next/bundle-analyzer.
- Document trade-offs in comments or status.md.
