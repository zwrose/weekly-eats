Prioritize security to prevent vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF). For high-risk areas (e.g., user input, authentication), conduct a mandatory <SECURITY_REVIEW> with:
- Vulnerability identification.
- Mitigation strategies (e.g., zod for validation).
- OWASP or Next.js references.
- Test to verify mitigation.
- Use secure defaults (e.g., helmet, zod) and avoid unsafe practices (e.g., eval).
