# Project Workflow

## Guiding Principles

1. **The Plan is the Source of Truth:** All work must be tracked in `plan.md`
2. **The Tech Stack is Deliberate:** Changes to the tech stack must be documented in `tech-stack.md` *before* implementation
3. **Test-Driven Development:** Write unit tests before implementing functionality
4. **High Code Coverage:** Aim for >80% code coverage for all modules
5. **User Experience First:** Every decision should prioritize user experience
6. **Non-Interactive & CI-Aware:** Prefer non-interactive commands. Use `CI=true` for watch-mode tools (tests, linters) to ensure single execution.

## Task Workflow

All tasks follow a strict lifecycle:

### Standard Task Workflow

1. **Select Task:** Choose the next available task from `plan.md` in sequential order

2. **Mark In Progress:** Before beginning work, edit `plan.md` and change the task from `[ ]` to `[~]`

3. **Write Failing Tests (Red Phase):**
   - Create a new test file for the feature or bug fix.
   - Write one or more unit tests that clearly define the expected behavior and acceptance criteria for the task.
   - **CRITICAL:** Run the tests and confirm that they fail as expected. This is the "Red" phase of TDD. Do not proceed until you have failing tests.

4. **Implement to Pass Tests (Green Phase):**
   - Write the minimum amount of application code necessary to make the failing tests pass.
   - Run the test suite again and confirm that all tests now pass. This is the "Green" phase.

5. **Refactor (Optional but Recommended):**
   - With the safety of passing tests, refactor the implementation code and the test code to improve clarity, remove duplication, and enhance performance without changing the external behavior.
   - Rerun tests to ensure they still pass after refactoring.

6. **Verify Coverage:** Run coverage reports using the project's chosen tools. For example, in a Python project, this might look like:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
   ```
   Target: >80% coverage for new code. The specific tools and commands will vary by language and framework.

7. **Document Deviations:** If implementation differs from tech stack:
   - **STOP** implementation
   - Update `tech-stack.md` with new design
   - Add dated note explaining the change
   - Resume implementation

8. **Commit Code Changes:**
   - Stage all code changes related to the task.
   - Propose a clear, concise commit message e.g, `feat(ui): Create basic HTML structure for calculator`.
   - Perform the commit.

9. **Attach Task Summary with Git Notes (Optional):**
   - **Step 9.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the *just-completed commit* (`git log -1 --format="%H"`).
   - **Step 9.2: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed summary using the enhanced format below.
   - **Step 9.3: Attach Note:** Use the `git notes` command to attach the summary to the commit.
     ```bash
     git notes add -m "<note content>" <commit_hash>
     ```

   **Enhanced Git Note Format:**
   ```markdown
   ## Task: [Task Name]

   ### Summary
   [Brief description of what was accomplished]

   ### Why
   [The rationale behind this implementation - why this approach was chosen]

   ### Changes
   - [List of changes made]
   - [Files created/modified]

   ### Decisions Made
   [Reference any ADRs recorded during this task]
   - ADR-001: [Decision title] (see decisions.md)
   - ADR-002: [Decision title] (see decisions.md)

   ### Files Modified
   - path/to/file1.ext
   - path/to/file2.ext
   ```

   **Note:** Git notes are optional. If your team prefers not to use git notes, skip this step. The commit message and plan.md provide core traceability.

10. **Update Plan Status (On Disk Only - Do NOT Commit):**
    - **Step 10.1: Get Commit SHA (if applicable):** If Step 9 was executed, obtain the first 7 characters of the commit hash.
    - **Step 10.2: Update Plan:** Read `plan.md`, find the line for the completed task, update its status from `[~]` to `[x]`, and append the commit SHA (e.g., `- [x] Task: Description [abc1234]`). If no commit was made, use `[uncommitted]`.
    - **Step 10.3: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to `plan.md`.
    - **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT commit `plan.md` separately. The plan update will be included in the next phase checkpoint commit. This keeps `plan.md` up-to-date on disk for status tracking while reducing commit noise.

### Phase Completion Verification and Checkpointing Protocol

**Trigger:** This protocol is executed immediately after a task is completed that also concludes a phase in `plan.md`.

1.  **Announce Protocol Start:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the verification and checkpointing protocol has begun.

2.  **Ensure Test Coverage for Phase Changes:**
    -   **Step 2.1: Determine Phase Scope:** To identify the files changed in this phase, you must first find the starting point. Read `plan.md` to find the Git commit SHA of the *previous* phase's checkpoint. If no previous checkpoint exists, the scope is all changes since the first commit.
    -   **Step 2.2: List Changed Files:** Execute `git diff --name-only <previous_checkpoint_sha> HEAD` to get a precise list of all files modified during this phase.
    -   **Step 2.3: Verify and Create Tests:** For each file in the list:
        -   **CRITICAL:** First, check its extension. Exclude non-code files (e.g., `.json`, `.md`, `.yaml`).
        -   For each remaining code file, verify a corresponding test file exists.
        -   If a test file is missing, you **must** create one. Before writing the test, **first, analyze other test files in the repository to determine the correct naming convention and testing style.** The new tests **must** validate the functionality described in this phase's tasks (`plan.md`).

3.  **Execute Automated Tests with Proactive Debugging:**
    -   Before execution, you **must** announce the exact shell command you will use to run the tests.
    -   **Example Announcement:** "I will now run the automated test suite to verify the phase. **Command:** `CI=true npm test`"
    -   Execute the announced command.
    -   If tests fail, you **must** inform the user and begin debugging. You may attempt to propose a fix a **maximum of two times**. If the tests still fail after your second proposed fix, you **must stop**, report the persistent failure, and ask the user for guidance.

4.  **Propose a Detailed, Actionable Manual Verification Plan:**
    -   **CRITICAL:** To generate the plan, first analyze `product.md`, `product-guidelines.md`, and `plan.md` to determine the user-facing goals of the completed phase.
    -   You **must** generate a step-by-step plan that walks the user through the verification process, including any necessary commands and specific, expected outcomes.
    -   The plan you present to the user **must** follow this format:

        **For a Frontend Change:**
        ```
        The automated tests have passed. For manual verification, please follow these steps:

        **Manual Verification Steps:**
        1.  **Start the development server with the command:** `npm run dev`
        2.  **Open your browser to:** `http://localhost:3000`
        3.  **Confirm that you see:** The new user profile page, with the user's name and email displayed correctly.
        ```

        **For a Backend Change:**
        ```
        The automated tests have passed. For manual verification, please follow these steps:

        **Manual Verification Steps:**
        1.  **Ensure the server is running.**
        2.  **Execute the following command in your terminal:** `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users -d '{"name": "test"}'`
        3.  **Confirm that you receive:** A JSON response with a status of `201 Created`.
        ```

5.  **Await Explicit User Feedback:**
    -   After presenting the detailed plan, ask the user for confirmation: "**Does this meet your expectations? Please confirm with yes or provide feedback on what needs to be changed.**"
    -   **PAUSE** and await the user's response. Do not proceed without an explicit yes or confirmation.

6.  **Create Checkpoint Commit (Includes Accumulated Plan Updates):**
    -   Stage all changes, **including the modified `plan.md`** which contains accumulated task status updates from this phase.
    -   Perform the commit with a clear and concise message (e.g., `conductor(checkpoint): Checkpoint end of Phase X`).

7.  **Attach Auditable Verification Report using Git Notes (Optional):**
    -   **Step 7.1: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed verification report including the automated test command, the manual verification steps, and the user's confirmation.
    -   **Step 7.2: Attach Note:** Use the `git notes` command and the full commit hash from the previous step to attach the full report to the checkpoint commit.
    -   **Note:** This step is optional. If your team prefers not to use git notes, skip this step.

8.  **Get and Record Phase Checkpoint SHA (On Disk Only - Do NOT Commit):**
    -   **Step 8.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the *just-created checkpoint commit* (`git log -1 --format="%H"`).
    -   **Step 8.2: Update Plan:** Read `plan.md`, find the heading for the completed phase, and append the first 7 characters of the commit hash in the format `[checkpoint: <sha>]`.
    -   **Step 8.3: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to `plan.md`.
    -   **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT commit this change separately. The checkpoint SHA annotation will be included in the next phase's checkpoint commit, or remain as an uncommitted working state after the final phase.

9.  **Announce Completion:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the checkpoint has been created.

### Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete, verify:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage meets requirements (>80%)
- [ ] Code follows project's code style guidelines (as defined in `code_styleguides/`)
- [ ] All public functions/methods are documented (e.g., docstrings, JSDoc, GoDoc)
- [ ] Type safety is enforced (e.g., type hints, TypeScript types, Go types)
- [ ] No linting or static analysis errors (using the project's configured tools)
- [ ] No anti-patterns detected (or documented exceptions)
- [ ] Works correctly on mobile (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced

### Quality Intelligence

Quality Intelligence provides automated analysis of code quality beyond basic test coverage. It includes:

1. **Anti-Pattern Detection**: Scans modified files for common code smells
2. **Coverage Intelligence**: Analyzes coverage reports and suggests priority tests

#### Anti-Pattern Detection

Anti-patterns are defined in `patterns/anti-patterns/` and categorized by severity:

| Severity | Behavior | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Critical** | Blocks task completion | (Reserved for security issues) |
| **High** | Warns, requires documented skip | God Object, Spaghetti Code, Mutable Defaults |
| **Medium** | Informational | Magic Numbers, Deep Nesting |

**Example Anti-Pattern Finding:**
```
⚠️ **Quality Gate: Issues Detected**

| Severity | File | Line | Anti-Pattern | Issue |
|----------|------|------|--------------|-------|
| 🔴 High | src/service.py | 45 | Mutable Defaults | `def process(items=[])` |
| 🟡 Medium | src/utils.py | 23 | Magic Numbers | Literal `86400` |

Options: (1) Fix issues (2) Skip with reason (3) View guidance
```

#### Coverage Intelligence

When a coverage report is available, Coverage Intelligence:
- Parses coverage data (lcov, Cobertura, Istanbul, etc.)
- Identifies uncovered functions and prioritizes by business impact
- Estimates coverage gain for each suggested test

**Example Coverage Suggestion:**
```
### Coverage Intelligence

**Current Coverage:** 75% (Target: 80%)

**Top Suggestions:**
1. `process_payment()` in services/payment.py (+2.5% gain)
   - Core business logic, currently untested
2. `validate_input()` in api/handlers.py (+1.8% gain)
   - Input validation with multiple branches
```

#### Skip Documentation

When skipping quality gate warnings, document the reason:

```markdown
### Quality Gate Decisions

**Skipped Anti-Patterns:**
- **Mutable Defaults** at src/service.py:45
  - Reason: Intentional memoization cache, documented in function docstring
  - Reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD

**Coverage Decisions:**
- Proceeding at 78% (target 80%)
  - Reason: Remaining 2% is generated code, will exclude in config
```
